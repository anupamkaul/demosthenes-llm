> Here's a clear explanation of all the agent* files in your directory:

## **agent-chat.py**
Interactive chat interface for the agent system. Loads a trained model and provides a conversation loop where users can input requests, and the agent 
predicts which function to call and executes it with confidence scores.

## **agent_functions.json**
Simple JSON configuration defining 6 available functions: get_weather, send_email, search_web, calculate, set_reminder, and no_function with their 
descriptions.

## **advanced-agent-dataset.py**
Generates an expanded training dataset with 10 functions including file operations (read_file, write_file, run_code) and multi-step reasoning capabilities. 
Creates train/validation/test splits.

## **agent-executor.py**
Function execution engine that takes predicted function names and user input, then executes the appropriate action. Contains helper methods to extract 
parameters like locations, recipients, and math expressions from natural language.

## **multi-step-agent.py**
Handles complex tasks requiring multiple function calls in sequence. Uses rule-based decomposition to break down requests like "check weather and email it" 
into separate steps, then executes them sequentially.

## **agent-finetune.py**
Training script that fine-tunes your Demosthenes LLM for agent function calling. Uses the same classification approach as your spam detection but for 
predicting which function to call based on user input.

## **agent-model.py**
Model setup that loads pretrained GPT-2 weights into your Demosthenes architecture, freezes most parameters, and replaces the output head with a 6-class 
classifier for function prediction. Only unfreezes the last transformer block for fine-tuning.

## **agent_datasetclass.py**
PyTorch Dataset class for loading agent training data. Handles tokenization, padding, and truncation of text inputs paired with function labels.

## **agent-dataset.py**
Generates basic training examples mapping natural language requests to function calls. Creates 12 examples across 6 functions with train/validation/test 
splits.

## **complete-agent.py**
Most advanced implementation combining all components with conversation memory, context awareness, and session saving. Handles follow-up questions, context 
references, and provides an interactive chat interface with debugging commands.

The files follow your classification fine-tuning pattern but adapt it for function calling - essentially treating function prediction as a 6-class 
classification problem where the model learns to map user intents to executable functions.
