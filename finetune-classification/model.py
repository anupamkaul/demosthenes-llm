'''

prepare the actual openAI GPT2 wt trained demosthenes model now.
next, replace out_head to classify only 2 output variables that
are required for classification finetuning

First, some choice configurations

'''

CHOOSE_MODEL = "gpt2-small (124M)"
INPUT_PROMPT = "Every effort moves"
BASE_CONFIG = {
    "vocab_size": 50257,
    "context_length": 1024,
    "drop_rate": 0.0,
    "qkv_bias": True
}
model_configs = {
    "gpt2-small (124M)": {"emb_dim": 768, "n_layers": 12, "n_heads": 12},
    "gpt2-medium (355M)": {"emb_dim": 1024, "n_layers": 24, "n_heads": 16},
    "gpt2-large (774M)": {"emb_dim": 1280, "n_layers": 36, "n_heads": 20},
    "gpt2-xl (1558M)": {"emb_dim": 1600, "n_layers": 48, "n_heads": 25},

BASE_CONFIG.update(model_configs[CHOOSE_MODEL])

Next, we import the download_and_load_gpt2 function from gpt_download.py and 
we reuse the GPTModel class (demosthenes) and load_weights_into_gpt function
from pretraining to download the weights into the GPT model. A hackier way is
also to simply read the model that I stored to the disk but I will skip that
for now and re-create the pretrained demosthenes model now

Starting point is ../pretraining/preloaded_weights/openai/scripts

import sys, os
sys.path.append( os.path.join( os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)),  '../pretraining/preloaded_weights/openai/scripts') )

    model_size=model_size, models_dir="gpt2"
)

model = GPTModel(BASE_CONFIG)
load_weights_into_gpt(model, params)
model.eval()
print("model with loaded weights is ready")

'''
After loading the model weights into the GPTModel, we reuse the text generation utility function 
from previous work to ensure that the model generates coherent text:
'''

from textgenerate import text_to_token_ids, generate_text_simple, token_ids_to_text, generate

import tiktoken
tokenizer = tiktoken.get_encoding("gpt2")

text_1 = "Every effort moves you"
token_ids = generate_text_simple(
    model=model,
    idx=text_to_token_ids(text_1, tokenizer),
    max_new_tokens=15,
    context_size=BASE_CONFIG["context_length"]
)
print(token_ids_to_text(token_ids, tokenizer))

# now check if classification prompts work (they won't as we
# haven't fine-tuned the model for classification prompts yet)

print("\n\nnow checking for classification prompts:")

text_2 = (
    "Is the following text 'spam'? Answer with 'yes' or 'no':"
    " 'You are a winner you have been specially"
    " selected to receive $1000 cash or a $2000 award.'"
)
token_ids = generate_text_simple(
    model=model,
    idx=text_to_token_ids(text_2, tokenizer),
    max_new_tokens=23,
    context_size=BASE_CONFIG["context_length"]
)
print(token_ids_to_text(token_ids, tokenizer))

'''
To prep the model for classification fine tuning, we replace the 
original output layer, which maps the hidden representation of 768
nodes to 50,257 (the token vocabulary) to 2 classes (0 - not spam, and
1 - spam). We use the same model as above which is pretrained, except
that we will replace the output layer and then train this model such
that only the edge most nodes of the outermost layer that we have replaced,
are tuned, thus achieving "fine tuning" of this model geared towards
classification.

Fine-tuning selected layers vs. all layers

Since we start with a pretrained model, itâ€™s not necessary to fine-tune 
all model layers. In neural network-based language models, the lower layers 
generally capture basic language structures and semantics applicable across 
a wide range of tasks and datasets. So, fine-tuning only the last layers 
(i.e., layers near the output), which are more specific to nuanced linguistic 
patterns and task-specific features, is often sufficient to adapt the model to 
new tasks. A nice side effect is that it is computationally more efficient to 
fine-tune only a small number of layers.
