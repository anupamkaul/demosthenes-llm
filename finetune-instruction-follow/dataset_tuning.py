'''
Construct the training batches and prepare everything
with the data until the point we need to prepare the 
model and fine tune it (this comes after download_dataset.py
and stylize_prompts.py)

Before we move on to setting up the PyTorch data loaders 
letâ€™s divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets 
analogous to what we have done with the spam classification dataset.

from download_dataset import download_and_load_file

file_path = "instruction-data.json"
url =  (
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch"
    "/main/ch07/01_main-chapter-code/instruction-data.json"
)

data = download_and_load_file(file_path, url)
print("Len of data: ", len(data))

# lets partition training 85%, test 10% and validation as 5%
train_portion = int(len(data) * 0.85)
test_portion  = int(len(data) * 0.1)
val_portion   = len(data) - train_portion - test_portion

train_data    = data[ : train_portion]
test_data     = data[train_portion : train_portion + test_portion]
val_data      = data[train_portion+test_portion : ]

print("Training set length:", len(train_data))
print("Test set length:", len(test_data))
print("Validation set length:", len(val_data))
