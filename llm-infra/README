I have already covered several aspects of the LLM architecture, such as input tokenization and embedding 
and the masked multi-head attention module. Now, I will implement the core structure of the GPT model, 
including its transformer blocks, which I will later train to generate human-like text.

Also scale up params from previous Attention chapter. Smallest GPT2 model has 124M params, GPT3 is 175B params.
Params are the trainable weghts of the model (all of them). 

Overall infrastructure for a GPT like LLM

- Coding a GPT-like large language model (LLM) that can be trained to generate human-like text

- Normalizing layer activations to stabilize neural network training

- Adding shortcut connections in deep neural networks

- Implementing transformer blocks to create GPT models of various sizes

- Computing the number of parameters and storage requirements of GPT models

Perusal:
After Tokenizers and Attention
