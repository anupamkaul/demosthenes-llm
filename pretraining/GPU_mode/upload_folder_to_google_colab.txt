I was able to upload demosthenes code to colab, use a tesla-t4 GPU, trained all of my models, ran inference, 
and downloaded it back (all done via .tar.gz) back to my local machines' Download folder: 

To upload a local folder from an Ubuntu machine to Google Colab for training, follow these steps: Compress the Folder.
Compress the entire folder you wish to upload into a ZIP or TAR.GZ archive. This simplifies the upload process and maintains the folder structure.
Code

    tar -czvf my_project_folder.tar.gz my_project_folder/
or
Code

    zip -r my_project_folder.zip my_project_folder/

--> I did this to demosthenes_llm
--> chose runtime GPU (from terminal at bottom)
--> from files (left) option I uploaded the zip file (into /home/anupam, I created anupam)
--> tar -xvzf <file>
--> ran python pretraining.py for the verdict, finished in less than 2 min, saved model in models/ and inference works
--> trying now with gutenberg/gutenberg, get a no training files found error and my script quits

===============================================

To move a folder structure from your Google Colab environment to your local machine, you generally need to compress the folder and then download the compressed file.
Here's a common method: Compress the folder in Colab.
You can use the zip command in the Colab terminal to compress your desired folder. Replace your_folder_name with the actual name of the folder you want to download and your_archive_name.zip with the desired name for your zip file.
Code

    !zip -r your_archive_name.zip your_folder_name
The -r flag ensures that the compression is recursive, including all subdirectories and files within your_folder_name. Download the compressed file.
After the folder is compressed, you can download the .zip file to your local machine using the files.download function from google.colab.
Python

    from google.colab import files
    files.download('your_archive_name.zip')

(this above code can be inserted in a cell and executed) 

(if it gives a chromium open error, try again)
I waited and did 2 methods:
1. ran this code in cell
2. went to files on the left, went to my file in /home/anupam/demo.tar.gz and right clicked and chose download
The demo.tar.gz was downloaded (twice) to my local Downloads folder. The tar contains full code + the models that I trained
on colab.

Q.E.D. I now have a method to use a Telsa GPU for free to train my models
