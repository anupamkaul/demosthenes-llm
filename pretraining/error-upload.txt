maybe github requires a "git lfs push" ..

interesting, this:
git lfs push --all --dry-run origin
push 196139668be63f3b5d6574427317ae82f612a97c5d1cdaf36ed2256dbf636783 => pretraining/gpt2/124M/encoder.json

(previously): 
git lfs push --all origin

need to try:
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/moving-a-file-in-your-repository-to-git-large-file-storage
(if you get an error that "this exceeds Git LFS's file size limit of 100 MiB" when you try to push files to Git, 
you can use git lfs migrate instead of filter-repo, to move the large file to Git Large File Storage. 
For more information about the git lfs migrate command, see the Git LFS 2.2.0 release announcement.)

the theory being that github's recieve hook refuses the large file because it hasn't been "migrated" first to LFS format
(its more than the tracking part)..

-- this is what I did ---
(First):
